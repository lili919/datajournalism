# China's gender inequality on women empowerment
 
The first data comes from United Nations Development Program about global gender inequality index. Here's a link to the original data: https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/documentation-and-downloads
This data was posted on September 8, 2022 and downloaded in Novermer, 2022. It looks at three dimensions - reproduction, female labor participation, and female empowerment.

From this website, I also found one specific data about China's gender inequality from 1990-2021. Here's a link to the original data: https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/CHN
This data was posted on September 8, 2022 and downloaded in Novermer, 2022. 

The second dataset comes from Council of Foreign relations about global political women power. Here's a link to the original data: https://www.cfr.org/article/womens-power-index#tablelink
This data was posted on March 29, 2021 and downloaded in Novermer, 2022. It focuses on women’s political participation, which measures women’s numerical presence of women rather than women’s impact or policy preferences.

These two datasets help understand how the overall situation of gender equality is and how it is in women's political participation in China.


The third dataset is from US-China Economic and Security Review Commission that examines the number of women's representation in Chinese leadership. Here's a link to the original data: https://www.uscc.gov/research/women-chinas-leadership
This data was published on March 30, 2022 and downloaded in November, 2022. It examines women's representation in China in three aspects - Chinese community party, Chinese government, Chinese military.
